:: This script will determine the PBO-name based on a file's content (last line will be considered for that.
:: That line may either specify the name as pboName="<The name>" or if it doesn't follow this scheme the complete
:: last line will be taken as the name.
:: The given file will be preprocessed before examination so using macros in order to determine the PBO-name is fine.
:: This script will set the pboName variable that may be accessed in the calling script.

:: Param 0: The path to the file containing the pboName
:: Param 1: The default value that should be used when the extraction of the file fails (The file doesn't exist)
